	<h2> Day 1 of #66daysofdata  </h2>
	<p>
		I started with revising the basics of Python. There are some expressions which always create some confusion. Sharing some of them

		1) Do you know the difference between round(4.8) and int(4.8)?
		Try guessing before proceeding further.
		int(x) removes whatever is present after the decimal.

		Code Sample:
		>>> int(4.8)
		4
		>>> round(4.8)
		5
		>>> int(4.2)
		4
		>>> round(4.2)
		4

		2) What would be the output for the expression (True or False):
		0.2+0.2+0.2==0.6

		If your answer was False, you guessed it right.

		Explanation:
		If you run 0.2+0.2+0.2, following is the output
		>>> 0.2+0.2+0.2
		0.6000000000000001

		You would wonder why? This is because the data is stored as binary format(base 2) in the computer, thus there is never a perfect base 10 number stored.

		So what is the solution, try rounding up after the summation, this brings the value as close as position to base 10:
		>> round(0.2+0.2+0.2,2)==round(0.6,2)
		True

		Amazing concept Ken Jee

	 Learn Python with me or revise if you know it already :)

	 Mutable vs Immutable Objects
	 -------------------------------

	 Mutable objects can be modified after their creation, same is not true in case of Immutable objects. 

	 What does this mean ? 

	 This means that a part of the object can be modified or something can be added without actually changing the reference pointer for a mutable object.
	Immutable objects cannot be modified but the value for the same can be reassigned, this basically creates a new reference pointer abandoning the previous one.

	Example for Mutable Objects: List, dict,set
	Example for Immutable Obkect: String, int, float

	What does this imply?

	This means that for a list listA[1]=4 is valid
	however for a string somestr,

	somestr[1]='1' will cause an exception

	Comment and tell me, what do you think? Is there something which is important that I should also know about mutability

	Zip in Python

	Sometime we get data for related fields like height and weight of a person in separate lists however there is a need to group them together.

	person = ["Tom", "George", "Harry"]
	weight = [10, 12, 14]
	height = [100, 103, 167]

	How do we aggregate them together

	Option 1: Use for loop and using the indexes put them together.

	Option 2 (zip) : Use the function zip, this can help to group the values together grouping on the basis of the individual sequence in the original lists

	>> zipped = zip(person,weight,height)

	One can make lists, dictionaries on top of it

	>> list(zipped)
	[('Tom', 10, 100), ('George', 12, 103), ('Harry', 14, 167)]

		List Comprehension in Python

		This provides a much compressed approach of creating a list using another iterable which can be another list on its own.

		Along with implementing the for loop it also gives the option to add if/ else statements in case of conditions to be checked for adding values.

		In case of list comprehension, array does not need to be declared beforehand

		new_list = [x*x if x%5==0 else x for x in old_list]

	Docstring conventions

	Documentation of the modules programmed is extremely essential, it not only makes the code easier to read but also makes it understandable.

	As per the Python documentation, "A docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a module, function, class, or method definition." .

	Comments and Docstring are similar due to the fact that both provides useful additional information about the code. However docstring is different from the comments given it consists of the first lines in the code which provides the details of the purpose and attributes of the definition.

	def method name():
	"""
	Docstring with details mentioned
	"""

	How do we access it? Through the special attribute __doc__ or the help function

	>> print(print.__doc__)
	>> help(print)

Function Annotation in Python

These are completely optional metadata added rather for usage by the developers than anything else. The interpreter does not understand these annotations and computes the operations

def somefunc(a:int, b:int) -> int
