		I started with revising the basics of Python. There are some expressions which always create some confusion. Sharing some of them

		1) Do you know the difference between round(4.8) and int(4.8)?
		Try guessing before proceeding further.
		int(x) removes whatever is present after the decimal.

		Code Sample:
		>>> int(4.8)
		4
		>>> round(4.8)
		5
		>>> int(4.2)
		4
		>>> round(4.2)
		4

		2) What would be the output for the expression (True or False):
		0.2+0.2+0.2==0.6

		If your answer was False, you guessed it right.

		Explanation:
		If you run 0.2+0.2+0.2, following is the output
		>>> 0.2+0.2+0.2
		0.6000000000000001

		You would wonder why? This is because the data is stored as binary format(base 2) in the computer, thus there is never a perfect base 10 number stored.

		So what is the solution, try rounding up after the summation, this brings the value as close as position to base 10:
		>> round(0.2+0.2+0.2,2)==round(0.6,2)
		True

		Amazing concept Ken Jee

	 Learn Python with me or revise if you know it already :)

	 Mutable vs Immutable Objects
	 -------------------------------

	 Mutable objects can be modified after their creation, same is not true in case of Immutable objects. 

	 What does this mean ? 

	 This means that a part of the object can be modified or something can be added without actually changing the reference pointer for a mutable object.
	Immutable objects cannot be modified but the value for the same can be reassigned, this basically creates a new reference pointer abandoning the previous one.

	Example for Mutable Objects: List, dict,set
	Example for Immutable Obkect: String, int, float

	What does this imply?

	This means that for a list listA[1]=4 is valid
	however for a string somestr,

	somestr[1]='1' will cause an exception

	Comment and tell me, what do you think? Is there something which is important that I should also know about mutability
